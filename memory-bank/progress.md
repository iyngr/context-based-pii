## Completed Tasks

*   Implemented a multi-service pipeline for PII redaction and Google Cloud Conversation Insights integration.
*   Defined the "end of call" signal mechanism using CCAI lifecycle notifications.
*   Designed and implemented data structures for storing conversation context in Redis (`main_service`) and aggregating utterances in Firestore (`transcript_aggregator_service`).
*   Researched and implemented Google Cloud Conversation Insights API for transcript ingestion, including JSONL format and explicit participant data.
*   Developed and deployed `ccai_insights_function` for dedicated Conversation Insights ingestion.
*   Implemented `transcript_aggregator_service`, including its architecture, Pub/Sub handlers, Firestore integration, CCAI integration, logging, and error handling.
*   Populated `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` for all services (`main_service`, `subscriber_service`, `transcript_aggregator_service`, `ccai_insights_function`).
*   Resolved various deployment and runtime errors across services, including `Location Mismatch`, `AlreadyExists`, `InvalidArgument`, `gunicorn: not found`, and `LRO Unexpected State`.
*   Enhanced DLP template handling and error reporting in `main_service`.
*   Refactored `call_dlp_for_redaction` in `main_service` to use `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable and correctly handle regional DLP operations.
*   Resolved "project_id is not defined" and "Invalid built-in info type name" errors in `main_service/main.py` related to DLP configuration.
*   Successfully configured and deployed CI/CD pipelines for all services using Google Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, and GitHub integration.
*   Optimized end-to-end test execution by reducing `time.sleep` delays in `e2e_test.py`.
*   Corrected DLP configuration for custom info types (e.g., `SOCIAL_HANDLE`) in `main_service/dlp_config.yaml` to ensure proper redaction and likelihood boosting.
*   Resolved `TypeError` in `main_service` by reverting to a previously working version of `call_dlp_for_redaction`, which correctly handles `info_type` construction for the DLP API.
*   Fixed `deidentify_config must be set` error by correcting the indentation of the `deidentify_config` section in `main_service/dlp_config.yaml`.
*   Resolved `TypeError: Parameter to MergeFrom() must be instance of same class` by correcting the structure of `info_types` within the `rule_set` in `main_service/dlp_config.yaml`.
